The idea is to tell a story of me becoming a developer.

A lot of people try to find the right job for a long time. Some of them keep on working at the position they don't like up to the pension. That's why I realize how happy I am as I've got the profession matching me exactly. 

## Childhood, schooldays and university

Long before thinking about the future, I was a usual child with common interests. There was an exception though as I was a mad [LEGO](https://www.lego.com) lover. My parents spent much money on different bundles. I built them using the instructions, then broke it and constructed new ideas generated in my brain. It may sound like a rave but I am absolutely sure that this hobby 
planted seeds of architecture, design and logical thinking in my mind.

School as the next part of my life gave me a good base in Math and understanding of the programming basics. It was interesting for me at the moment of studying but at that time I didn't even think that it could be my job in some years.

Finally, I was graduating the school but had almost 0 ideas about my future. Talks with my father and researching different job types guided me to the IT field. I had some doubts choosing between Computer Science and Electronics but my intuition suggested me to go to CS.

The beginning of university life was pretty unusual for me. I made new acquaintances, understood the estimation system and remembered the location of the audience. Here I started coding in Python which is a brilliant way to start learning to programme.

Half of the year past I realized that I have a lot of free time and can spend it usefully. That's why I began to take online courses, read the books and practice different things from game development using Lua to solving algorithmic problems with C++.

## Professional start

Thanks to my efforts, at the beginning of the 2nd year of university I got an internship in [Attractor Software](https://www.attractor-software.com/). 3 months of the internship passed very quickly and productively. I learnt the basics of networking, clean code, SOLID principles, and design patterns. I think besides the all hard skills I showed, a big impact was made by communication with people, sharing ideas and knowledge I had with the others and being always involved in the team. Finally, I was invited to become a [Full Stack Developer in this company](/#a-hrefhttpswwwattractor-softwarecom-target_blankattractor-softwarea).
